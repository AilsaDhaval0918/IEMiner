IEClassifier

		Software Used: IEClassifier desinged

		IEClassifier <<Result from class 1>>  <<Result from class 2>> <<Input data file for class 1>> <<Input data file for class 2>> << Test file for class 1 >> << Test file for class 2 >>

		Example:
		IEClassifier result_db0.data result_dc0.data part_db0.data part_dc0.data pattern_0.data pat0.data path0.data
	
		Where
		result_db0.data - {Result from class 1, first use IEMiner provided in this directory}
 		result_dc0.data - {Result from class 2, first use IEMiner provided in this directory}
		part_db0.data   - {Input data file for class 1}
		part_dc0.data   - {Input data file for class 2}
		pat0.data  	- {test file for class 1}
		path0.data  	- {test file for class 2}
		
		
		Hence code will be:
		IEMiner part_db0.data 0.10 result_db0.data
		IEMiner part_dc0.data 0.10 result_dc0.data
		IEClassifier result_db0.data result_dc0.data part_db0.data part_dc0.data pattern_0.data pat0.data path0.data

      For each Test file, Output is
      
      No. of Class 1 for testing:P1
      	Correctly classified instance by BestConf strategy: A1
      	Correctly classified instance by Malority_Class strategy: B1
      No. of class 2 for testing:Q1	
       Correctly classified instance by BestConf strategy: C1
       Correctly classified instance by Malority_Class strategy: D1
            
      Hence, classification accuracy for this  test file is:
       
			 Classification accuracy for BestConf strategy :  (A1+C1)/(P1+Q1)
			 Classification accuracy for Majority_Class  :  (B1+D1)/(P1+Q1)		  				

(*) In our current implementation, we have combined implementation of BestConf strategy and Majority_Class strategy also has the fixed parameter
for information gain. Currently it only support for classification of two class only. As well as user has to partition the 
data for implementing the 10-fold cross validation.
